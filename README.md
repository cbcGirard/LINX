### Interact with the world using LabVIEW to control embedded platforms like Arduino and chipKIT and myRIO.

LINX provides easy to use VIs for interacting with common embedded platforms like Arduino, chipKIT and myRIO. Use the built in sensor VIs to start getting data to your PC in seconds or use the peripheral VIs to access your devices digital I/O, analog I/O, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM and more.
